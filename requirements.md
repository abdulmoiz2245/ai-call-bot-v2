# üìû Call-Bot SaaS ‚Äî Full Product Prompt (Validated & Completed)

We‚Äôre building a **multi-tenant call-bot platform** that lets companies create outbound **voice campaigns** powered by **ElevenLabs TTS** and a pluggable **Call Gateway** (Twilio/Maqsam/SIP). Users register, pick a company type, create campaigns with schedules, import data (orders, leads, contacts), assign agents, and analyze results in a premium **shadcn-vue** UI.

## üîë Principles
- **Reusable**: Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository. Services are business-logic first; repositories do DB only.
- **Scalable**: multi-tenant, modular, background jobs, provider adapters.
- **Simple where possible**: don‚Äôt over-engineer; prioritize reuse in services.
- **Premium UX**: clean, modern, fast. All tables use server-side pagination + filters via AJAX.
- **Event-driven**: everything emits auditable events.

## üì¶ Modules

### 1. Authentication & RBAC
- Signup ‚Üí select Company Type ‚Üí redirect to dashboard.

  - Auto-populate Product/Category/Brand if new.
  - CRUD orders + items inline.
- Generic Leads for non-ecommerce.

### 8. Scheduling & Execution Engine
- Background jobs (Redis workers).
- **CampaignScheduler**: enqueue eligible contacts/orders by schedule.
- **CallJob**: originate call, handle webhooks, retries.
- Timezone-aware execution.

### 9. Reports & Analytics
- Campaign Dashboard:
  - attempts, connected, voicemail, busy, failed, retries, completion %
  - funnel: attempted ‚Üí connected ‚Üí successful
  - answered heatmap
- Agent Performance
- Contact Outcomes
- **Cost Tracking**:
  - call cost, TTS usage, per campaign/agent/segment
- Export: CSV/PDF
- Server-side filters + pagination.

### 10. Settings & Integrations
- ElevenLabs test & key validation.
- Call gateway test call.
- Webhooks:
  - call.status.updated, contact.opted_out, campaign.completed, import.completed
- Public REST API:
  - push contacts/leads/orders, start/stop campaign, fetch reports.
- Optional CRM connectors (Shopify, HubSpot, Zoho).

### 11. Audit Trail / Events
- Actions emit events:
  - campaign.created, import.completed, call.answered, dnc.added, etc.
- Event viewer with filters + export.

### 12. Compliance & Security
- GDPR/HIPAA modes:
  - data retention policies
  - PII masking for non-privileged roles
  - mandatory opt-out enforcement
  - immutable audit logs

## ‚öôÔ∏è Developer Guidelines

### Architecture
- **Controllers**: request/response, validation, tenancy.
- **Services**: business logic (scheduling, retries, DNC, costs).
- **Repositories**: raw DB queries.
- **Adapters**: GatewayAdapter, StorageAdapter, ImportParser.

### Example Service Contracts
- `CampaignService`: create, update, activate, archive, enqueue batch, compute stats
- `CallingService`: originate call, handle webhook, schedule retry
- `ImportService`: detect file type, dryRun, import
- `DncService`: add/remove/check
- `CostService`: record(callId, gatewayCost, ttsUnits)

### Status Enums
- **Contact**: `new | queued | calling | called | success | failed | opted_out`
- **Call**: `queued | ringing | answered | voicemail | busy | failed | no_answer`
- **Import**: `pending | validating | running | completed | failed`

### Imports
- CSV/XLSX with column mapping UI.
- Auto-populate entities during import.
- Chunked processing for large files.



## üìä Non-Functional Requirements
- Observability: structured logs, metrics, tracing.
- DB migrations & seeders (roles, agent templates, demo data).
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts.
- Horizontal scalability of workers.
- Per-tenant concurrency enforcement.
